A Safari extension that automatically enables Picture-in-Picture (PiP) mode for videos when switching tabs or scrolling to comments.

## ✨ Features

- Automatic PiP when switching tabs or scrolling to YouTube comments
- Smart detection of actively playing videos
- Automatic disable when returning to video tab
- Support for multiple streaming platforms
- Global on/off toggle to temporarily disable AutoPiP without removing the extension
- Configurable keyboard shortcut to manually trigger PiP (default: ⌥P)
- Blacklist / Whitelist mode to control which sites AutoPiP is active on

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. Download the latest release [here](https://github.com/vordenken/AutoPiP/releases)
2. Install and enable the Safari extension
3. Start watching videos - PiP activates automatically!

> **Updating:** To receive updates, open the AutoPiP app from time to time. Sparkle checks for updates automatically (once per day).

## 🎯 Compatibility

| ✅ Supported | ❌ Not Supported | ⁉️ Untested |
|-------------|-----------------|------------|
| YouTube     | Amazon Prime    | MAX        |
| Twitch      | Apple TV+*     |            |
| Disney+     |                |            |
| Paramount+  |                |            |
| Netflix     |                |            |
| Jellyfin    |                |            |

*AppleTV opens the native app instead of Safari

> Most HTML5 video players should work. Compatibility may vary based on DRM restrictions and Safari/macOS versions.

## 💻 Requirements

- macOS 13.5 or later
- Safari 16 or later

> I wanted to add Chrome/Firefox support but Safari is the only browser that allows calling PiP without user-interaction - So unless this changes, AutoPiP will be Safari only
